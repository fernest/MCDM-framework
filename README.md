# *MCDM-ConSel* – a Framework for Blockchain Consensus Protocol Selection using MCDM


## Goal of this repository

Selecting the most suitable consensus protocol for a particular DLT system is essential. At the same time, a challenging step, as developers need to make a trade-off between conflicting requirements of a blockchain system.

This repository provides an Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) framework for researchers and practitioners to select the most suitable consensus protocols (or other DLT system components) for specific blockchain systems or applications.

## The steps of the *MCDM-ConSel* framework

- Problem definition

- Selection of the alternatives

- Selection of the evaluation criteria

- Data processing

- Criteria weighting

- Ranking alternatives

The more detailed description of each step will be published soon

## The framework‘s tools

A freely available (on-demand) MS Excel-based MCDM tool (Wang and Rangaiah,2017; Wang et al., 2020) is utilized for the experimental investigation.

The tool implements 14 different MCDM methods (SAW, TOPSIS, VIKOR, etc.) in total and it could be used for extensive performed analysis.

## The data set for the framework

The data set was developed with the aim of identifying the preferable consensus protocols for the blockchain system according to its requirements. 

Currently, the data set consists of categorized quantitative and qualitative data reflecting 18 state-of-the-art consensus protocols aggregated from various sources.

The consensus protocols are grouped by families, and the most popular platform utilizing the protocol is indicated. We also identify the main criteria groups and criteria corresponding to the collected features and metrics. 

Moreover, together with the collected raw data, we provide the processed data ready to use by various MCDM methods.
